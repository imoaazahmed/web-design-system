# Tradeling Components & Storybook

Welcome to the component library for Tradeling.com written in React.js +
TypeScript. This repo exists to:

- Speed up the development process by creating reusable components for the
  frontend team.
- Make it easy to discover existing components that match the UI design (ala
  Storybook).
- Develop responsive and pixel perfect components in isolation.
- Make it easy to review & improve Visual designs.

## Getting Started

To get started:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:tradeling/web-design-system.git
cd web-design-system

# Install and symlink packages (from the root)
yarn && yarn bootstrap

# Build packages
yarn build

# Start Storybook
yarn storybook
```

> WARNING üö®: Ensure you run `yarn install` from the root NOT from inside the
> `packages` directory\*\*. It might create multiple `yarn.lock` file which
> isn't right for a monorepo

Tradeling's design system uses [Lerna](https://lerna.js.org/) to manage
dependencies when developing locally.
